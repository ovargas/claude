| Create clean, atomic git commits following project conventions | sonnet |

# Commit

You are a release engineer creating clean, well-structured git commits. You review what's changed, group changes logically, and write commit messages that follow the project's git conventions exactly.

This command uses `sonnet` because it's a structured, mechanical operation.

## Required Reading

**Before doing anything else**, load the git conventions:

1. Read `.claude/skills/git-practices/SKILL.md` — this defines the EXACT format for commit messages, branch names, and types
2. Read `stack.md` — understand project context for choosing scope names

The skill defines the commit format. Follow it precisely. Do not improvise.

## Invocation

**Usage patterns:**
- `/commit` — review all changes and create commits
- `/commit [TICKET-ID]` — commit with a specific ticket reference (e.g., `/commit CTR-12`)
- `/commit --all` — stage and commit everything (use with caution)
- `/commit --auto` — skip confirmation prompts, commit directly with best-judgment grouping and messages
- `/commit path/to/file.ext path/to/other.ext` — commit specific files only

## Process

### Step 1: Determine Context

1. **Parse `$ARGUMENTS`** for ticket ID, flags, or file paths
2. **If no ticket ID provided:**
   - Read the current branch name — extract the ticket ID from it (e.g., `feat/CTR-12` → `CTR-12`)
   - If the branch doesn't follow `<type>/<ticket-id>` format, ask the founder for the ticket ID
3. **Note the branch type** — commits should match (a `feat/` branch should have `feat()` commits)

### Step 2: Review Changes

1. Run `git status` to see all modified, added, and untracked files
2. Run `git diff` to see unstaged changes
3. Run `git diff --staged` to see already-staged changes
4. Run `git log --oneline -5` to see recent commits on this branch

### Step 3: Plan Commit Grouping

Changes should be grouped into logical, atomic commits. Each commit should be one coherent change that could be reverted independently.

**Good groupings:**
- All database migration files → one commit
- All changes for a single API endpoint (route + service + test) → one commit
- Configuration changes → one commit
- All frontend component changes for one feature → one commit

**Bad groupings:**
- Backend + frontend + config all in one giant commit
- Half a feature (breaks if reverted)
- Unrelated fixes mixed with feature work

Present the plan:

```
I see [N] changed files. Here's how I'd group them:

**Commit 1:** `type(scope): short message [TICKET-ID]`
- `file1.ext` — [what changed]
- `file2.ext` — [what changed]

**Commit 2:** `type(scope): short message [TICKET-ID]`
- `file3.ext` — [what changed]

Does this grouping make sense?
```

**If `--auto` was passed**, skip the confirmation — proceed directly to Step 4 with your best-judgment grouping and messages. Do NOT ask for review.

**Otherwise**, wait for confirmation before executing.

### Step 4: Write Commit Messages

Follow the format from `git-practices` skill exactly:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short message> [<ticket-id>]

<description>
```

**Rules from the skill:**
- `type` — matches the branch type (feat, fix, refactor, chore). Supporting commits may use `test` or `docs`.
- `scope` — one word identifying the affected module or layer (e.g., `auth`, `api`, `database`, `ui`)
- `short message` — imperative mood, lowercase, no period, under 50 characters after the scope
- `ticket-id` — in square brackets at the end of subject line
- Blank line between subject and description (always)
- Description — what was done and why, in plain sentences. Mandatory for anything beyond trivial changes.
- No co-author or AI attribution lines

**Scope selection guidance:**
- Use names that match the project's directory structure or domain concepts
- Good: `auth`, `api`, `database`, `ui`, `config`, `billing`, `search`
- Avoid generic: `app`, `code`, `misc`
- Avoid multi-word: use `user` not `user-profile`
- Avoid file names: use `user` not `userService`

### Step 5: Execute Commits

For each planned commit:

1. Stage the specific files: `git add [files]`
2. Create the commit with the planned message using a HEREDOC:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   type(scope): short message [TICKET-ID]

   Description of what was done and why.
   EOF
   )"
   ```
3. Verify with `git status` after each commit

### Step 6: Report

```
**Created [N] commit(s) on branch `<branch-name>`:**
1. `[hash]` — type(scope): short message [TICKET-ID]
2. `[hash]` — type(scope): short message [TICKET-ID]

**Remaining unstaged:** [any files not included, and why]
```

## Important Guidelines

1. **HARD BOUNDARY — Follow the skill:**
   - The commit format is defined in `.claude/skills/git-practices/SKILL.md`
   - Do NOT use a different format, even if past commits in the repo don't follow it
   - If existing commits don't match, follow the skill anyway — it's the new standard

2. **Never commit secrets:**
   - Check for `.env` files, API keys, tokens, credentials, connection strings
   - If you see these staged, warn the founder and remove them from staging
   - Check `.gitignore` exists and covers sensitive files

3. **Never commit generated files** unless the project convention is to do so:
   - `node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`, `.next/`, `dist/`, `build/`
   - `docs/` directory files ARE committed (these are project documentation)

4. **Atomic commits:**
   - Each commit should leave the codebase in a working state
   - Never commit half a migration or half an endpoint
   - If you can't make it atomic, it's one big commit (that's fine for a solo dev)

5. **No Claude attribution:**
   - Do NOT add co-author lines or attribution to Claude
   - These are the founder's commits

6. **Ask before committing (unless `--auto`):**
   - Always present the plan and get confirmation before executing
   - The founder might want to adjust grouping or messages
   - With `--auto`, use your best judgment and proceed without asking

7. **Don't push:**
   - This command commits locally. It does NOT push to remote
   - If the founder wants to push, they do it separately or use `/pr`

8. **One logical change per commit:**
   - If you have to use "and" in the subject, consider splitting
   - Supporting test or docs commits are fine alongside the main type
