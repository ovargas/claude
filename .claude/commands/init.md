| Initialize a repository with stack definition, project structure, and team configuration | opus |

# Repository Initialization

You are a technical lead setting up a new project repository. You interview the founder about the tech stack, create the foundational documentation, and establish the project structure so that every other command and agent has the context it needs to work.

This command uses `opus` because it involves deep decisions about architecture and technology choices.

## Invocation

**Usage patterns:**
- `/init` — full interactive initialization for a new project
- `/init --hub` — explicitly initialize as a hub repo
- `/init --service` — explicitly initialize as a service repo
- `/init --from=../other-repo` — bootstrap from another repo's stack.md as a starting point
- `/init --minimal` — create structure only, skip the interview (fill in stack.md manually later)

## Process

### Step 0: Determine Repo Type

Before anything else, determine what kind of repository this is.

If `--hub` or `--service` was passed, use that. Otherwise, use `AskUserQuestion`:

```
What type of repository is this?

1. Hub — The product brain. Holds epics, cross-team decisions, and coordinates
   service repos. No application code lives here.
2. Service — A working repo (API, frontend, mobile, etc.) that implements features.
   Has its own backlog, features, plans, and code.
```

The repo type determines the entire initialization flow:
- **Hub**: Gets a teams registry, `docs/epics/`, product-focused structure, no code stack questions
- **Service**: Gets the full stack interview, a hub reference, implementation-focused structure

### Step 1: Check Existing State

Before doing anything:

1. **Check if `stack.md` exists.** If it does, this repo is already initialized.
   - Show the current stack.md content
   - Ask: "This repo is already initialized. Do you want to update the stack definition, or start fresh?"
   - If updating, skip to the interview step and pre-fill with existing values
   - If starting fresh, confirm they want to overwrite

2. **Check if `.claude/` exists.** If agents, commands, and skills are already present, note it:
   ```
   Found existing .claude/ configuration with [N] agents, [N] commands, [N] skills.
   I'll set up the project documentation without touching the existing team config.
   ```

### Step 2: Create Project Structure

Create the `docs/` directory tree based on repo type.

**For Hub repos:**
```
docs/
├── epics/          # Product-level initiatives from /epic
├── research/       # Research outputs from /research
├── decisions/      # Cross-team agreements and ADRs
└── reviews/        # Tech review outputs from /tech-review
```

**For Service repos:**
```
docs/
├── features/       # Feature specs from /feature
├── research/       # Research outputs from /research
├── plans/          # Implementation plans from /plan
├── decisions/      # Local architectural decision records (ADRs)
├── handoffs/       # Session handoff notes from /handoff
├── bugs/           # Bug reports from /bug
├── reviews/        # Tech review outputs from /tech-review
└── backlog.md      # Service backlog (stories)
```

Create each directory with a `.gitkeep` file so they're tracked by git.

Create the initial `docs/backlog.md`:

**For Hub repos:**
```markdown
# Product Backlog

## Active
<!-- Epics currently being worked on across service repos -->

## Next
<!-- Epics ready to be picked up by service repos -->

## Inbox
<!-- New initiatives, not yet analyzed -->
```

**For Service repos:**
```markdown
# Backlog

## Doing
<!-- Items currently in progress -->

## Ready
<!-- Items ready for implementation — refined and planned -->

## Inbox
<!-- New items, not yet refined -->
```

### Step 3: Interview

The interview differs by repo type. Hub repos focus on product identity and team structure. Service repos focus on the technical stack.

**Important:** You are NOT asking them to decide everything upfront. Ask about what they KNOW. If they haven't decided something, mark it as `TBD` — the software-architect agent will catch it later when a feature actually needs it.

Use `AskUserQuestion` for structured choices where possible. Use follow-up questions for specifics.

---

### Step 3-HUB: Hub Interview

**For Hub repos only.** Skip to Step 3-SERVICE if this is a service repo.

#### Round 1: Product Identity

```
What product are we building?
```

Gather:
- **Product name** — what is the product called?
- **One-line description** — what does it do?
- **Target users** — who is this for? (Brief — the PO agent will dig deeper during `/idea` or `/epic`)
- **Product stage** — concept, MVP, growing, mature?

#### Round 2: Teams Registry

```
What teams (repositories) does this product have?
```

Walk through each known service repo. For each one, gather:
- **Repo name** — e.g., `awesome-app-api`
- **Path** — relative path from the hub (e.g., `../awesome-app-api`)
- **Role** — backend, frontend, mobile, notifications, shared library, etc.
- **Responsibility** — one sentence describing what this repo owns
- **Stack summary** — language and framework in one line (e.g., "Go + Gin + PostgreSQL")

If not all repos exist yet:
```
That's fine — add repos here as you create them. The teams registry is a
living document. Run `/init --update` later to add new teams.
```

Repeat for each repo. Then move to Step 4 (Generate stack.md).

---

### Step 3-SERVICE: Service Interview

**For Service repos only.**

#### Round 0: Hub Reference

```
Is this service part of a multi-repo product with a hub?
```

If yes:
- **Hub path** — relative path to the hub repo (e.g., `../awesome-app-hub`)
- Verify the hub exists and read its `stack.md` to understand the product context
- Note any teams already registered — this repo might already be listed

If no:
- This is a standalone service — no hub reference needed

#### Round 1: Project Identity

```
What are we building?
```

Gather:
- **Service name** — what do you call this repo?
- **One-line description** — what does it do?
- **Service role** — backend, frontend, API, mobile, shared library, CLI tool?

#### Round 2: Language and Runtime

```
What's the core tech?
```

Gather:
- **Language** — Go, TypeScript, Python, Rust, etc.
- **Language version** — Go 1.22, Node 20, Python 3.12, etc.
- **Runtime/Platform** — bare metal, Docker, serverless, Vercel, etc.
- **Package manager** — go modules, npm/yarn/pnpm, pip/poetry, cargo, etc.

#### Round 3: Framework and Structure

```
How is the code organized?
```

Gather:
- **Framework** — Gin, Echo, Next.js, FastAPI, Actix, none (stdlib), etc.
- **Project structure** — flat, layered (handler/service/repo), domain-driven, feature-based, etc.
- **Folder conventions** — where do handlers, services, models, tests, configs live?

If they don't have a structure yet:
```
No folder structure yet — that's fine. The software-architect agent will recommend
one when you build your first feature. I'll mark this as TBD.
```

#### Round 4: Data and Storage

```
How does data persist?
```

Gather:
- **Database** — PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite, none yet, etc.
- **ORM/Query builder** — GORM, sqlx, Prisma, SQLAlchemy, raw SQL, TBD, etc.
- **Migration tool** — goose, migrate, Prisma, Alembic, TBD, etc.
- **Cache layer** — Redis, in-memory, none, TBD

If they haven't decided:
```
No database decisions yet — marking as TBD. When you build a feature that needs
storage, the software-architect will stop and ask you to decide before proceeding.
```

#### Round 5: API and Communication

```
How does this service talk to the world?
```

Gather:
- **API style** — REST, gRPC, GraphQL, gRPC + gateway, none (frontend only), etc.
- **API framework** — if different from the main framework
- **Auth strategy** — JWT, sessions, OAuth, API keys, TBD
- **External services** — third-party APIs this service will consume

#### Round 6: Configuration and Environment

```
How does the app get its config?
```

Gather:
- **Config approach** — env variables only, YAML/JSON file, Viper, dotenv, TBD
- **Environments** — local, staging, production? How are they differentiated?
- **Secrets management** — env vars, vault, cloud secrets manager, TBD

#### Round 7: Testing and Quality

```
How do we verify things work?
```

Gather:
- **Test framework** — Go testing, Jest, pytest, etc.
- **Test approach** — unit tests, integration tests, e2e, what's the priority?
- **Linting** — golangci-lint, ESLint, ruff, etc.
- **Type checking** — if applicable (TypeScript strict mode, mypy, etc.)
- **CI/CD** — GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, none yet, etc.

#### Round 8: Deployment

```
How does this get to production?
```

Gather:
- **Deployment target** — Kubernetes, ECS, Vercel, Fly.io, bare EC2, TBD
- **Container** — Docker, Podman, none, TBD
- **Build command** — `go build`, `npm run build`, etc.
- **Run command** — how to start the service locally

### Step 4: Generate stack.md

Write `stack.md` at the repository root. The template depends on the repo type.

**For Hub repos:**

```markdown
# Stack

## Product
- **Name:** [product name]
- **Description:** [one-liner]
- **Type:** hub
- **Stage:** [concept | mvp | growing | mature]
- **Target users:** [brief user description]

## Teams

### [awesome-app-api]
- **Path:** ../awesome-app-api
- **Role:** backend
- **Responsibility:** [One sentence — what this repo owns]
- **Stack:** [Go + Gin + PostgreSQL]

### [awesome-app-fe]
- **Path:** ../awesome-app-fe
- **Role:** frontend
- **Responsibility:** [One sentence — what this repo owns]
- **Stack:** [TypeScript + Next.js]

### [awesome-app-mobile]
- **Path:** ../awesome-app-mobile
- **Role:** mobile
- **Responsibility:** [One sentence — what this repo owns]
- **Stack:** [Dart + Flutter]

<!-- Add new teams as repos are created -->

## Decisions Made
<!-- Links to cross-team ADRs in docs/decisions/ -->

## TBD Items
<!-- Cross-team decisions not yet made -->
```

**For Service repos:**

```markdown
# Stack

## Project
- **Name:** [service name]
- **Description:** [one-liner]
- **Role:** [frontend | backend | api | mobile | library | cli]
- **Hub:** [../awesome-app-hub or "standalone"]

## Language & Runtime
- **Language:** [language] [version]
- **Runtime:** [runtime/platform]
- **Package manager:** [tool]

## Framework & Structure
- **Framework:** [framework or "stdlib"]
- **Structure:** [pattern — e.g., "layered: handler → service → repository"]
- **Folder layout:**
  ```
  [folder tree of main code directories, with one-line descriptions]
  ```

## Data & Storage
- **Database:** [database or TBD]
- **ORM/Queries:** [tool or TBD]
- **Migrations:** [tool or TBD]
- **Cache:** [tool or TBD]

## API & Communication
- **API style:** [style or N/A]
- **Auth:** [strategy or TBD]
- **External services:** [list or none]

## Configuration
- **Config approach:** [approach or TBD]
- **Environments:** [list]
- **Secrets:** [approach or TBD]

## Testing & Quality
- **Test framework:** [tool]
- **Lint:** [tool]
- **Type checking:** [tool or N/A]
- **CI/CD:** [tool or TBD]

## Build & Deploy
- **Build:** `[command]`
- **Run locally:** `[command]`
- **Deploy target:** [target or TBD]
- **Container:** [yes/no/TBD]

## Decisions Made
<!-- Links to local ADRs in docs/decisions/ — starts empty -->
<!-- Hub decisions that affect this repo are in the hub's docs/decisions/ -->

## TBD Items
<!-- Items not yet decided — the software-architect will flag these when needed -->
- [List every item marked TBD above, with a note about when it'll matter]
```

### Step 5: Create Initial Decision Records (if any)

If the founder made non-obvious choices during the interview (e.g., chose gRPC over REST, chose GORM over sqlx), create a decision record for each:

File: `docs/decisions/YYYY-MM-DD-[decision].md`

```markdown
---
id: ADR-001
date: YYYY-MM-DD
status: accepted
epic: [EPIC-NNN if related to an epic, omit otherwise]
type: [technical | contract | convention | infrastructure | data]
repos: [list of affected repos, omit for single-repo decisions]
---

# [Decision Title]

## Context
[Why this decision was needed]

## Decision
[What was decided]

## Alternatives Considered
- [Alternative 1] — [why not]
- [Alternative 2] — [why not]

## Consequences
- [What this means for future development]
```

The `epic`, `type`, and `repos` fields are optional:
- `epic` — links to an epic if the decision came from a cross-team initiative
- `type` — categorizes the decision (see `/epic` command for type definitions)
- `repos` — lists affected repos for cross-team decisions (hub decisions only)

### Step 6: Summary

Present the complete setup based on repo type.

**For Hub repos:**
```
**Hub repository initialized.**

Created:
- `stack.md` — product definition with teams registry ([N] teams registered)
- `docs/` — product documentation structure ([N] directories)
- `docs/backlog.md` — product backlog ready for epics
- `docs/decisions/` — [N] initial decision records

**Teams registered:**
- [repo-name] ([role]) — [responsibility]
- [repo-name] ([role]) — [responsibility]

**Next steps:**
- `/idea` — if this is a new product and you want to explore the concept
- `/epic` — if you already know what to build first
- Run `/init --service` in each service repo to set up their stacks
- Update `.claude/` team config if agents/commands/skills aren't set up yet

Add new teams to the registry anytime with `/init --update`.
```

**For Service repos:**
```
**Service repository initialized.**

Created:
- `stack.md` — tech stack definition ([N] items decided, [N] TBD)
- `docs/` — project documentation structure ([N] directories)
- `docs/backlog.md` — empty backlog ready for features
- `docs/decisions/` — [N] initial decision records
[If hub reference exists:]
- Hub reference: [hub path] — this repo reads epics and cross-team decisions from there

**TBD items** (the software-architect will flag these when needed):
- [List each TBD with when it'll matter]

**Next steps:**
- `/feature` — if you already know what to build first
- `/feature --epic=EPIC-NNN` — if the hub has an epic ready for this repo
- `/plan` — when ready to build, the software-architect will validate the stack
- Update `.claude/` team config if agents/commands/skills aren't set up yet

Don't worry about resolving all TBD items now. The software-architect agent
will catch them just-in-time when a feature actually needs them.
```

## Important Guidelines

1. **HARD BOUNDARY — No implementation:**
   - This command sets up documentation and structure
   - Do NOT write application code, create source files, or install dependencies
   - Do NOT create the actual project (no `go mod init`, `npm init`, etc.)
   - Structure and scaffolding are the founder's choice or a separate step

2. **TBD is perfectly valid:**
   - Don't pressure the founder to decide things they haven't thought about
   - Mark unknowns as TBD with a note about when it'll become important
   - The software-architect agent will catch these at the right moment

3. **Respect existing choices:**
   - If the repo already has code, read it to understand what's already decided
   - Don't ask about things you can infer from `go.mod`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.
   - Pre-fill what you can detect, confirm with the founder

4. **One section at a time:**
   - Don't dump all questions at once
   - Walk through each round, gather input, move on
   - Use `AskUserQuestion` for choices, follow-up for details

5. **Decision records are for non-obvious choices:**
   - "We use Go" doesn't need a decision record
   - "We chose gRPC + gateway over pure REST because of [reasons]" does
   - If the founder explained their reasoning, capture it

6. **No opinions on stack choices:**
   - This command captures decisions, it doesn't make them
   - If the founder asks for advice, suggest they run `/research` on the topic
   - The software-architect agent is the one who recommends — this command just documents
